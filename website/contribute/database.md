There are several ways to contribute or modify CDB data:
(1) via the website, and
(2) via pull requests, and
(3) by filing issues
For small updates, we recommend using the website.
For larger bulk additions, we recommend a pull request (and a heads up).

## Contributing via the Website

This is currently partially implemented, the edit button will generate an issue with the changes but it is not yet automatically handled.

## Contributing via Pull Requests

The CDB database uses a standard fork and PR request model for making contributions.

## Helping with Issues

The current issues are at [here](https://github.com/cvedb/cdb-database/issues). If you see something that doesn't look right or is missing please feel free to file an issue mentioning the entry(s) and problem(s).
