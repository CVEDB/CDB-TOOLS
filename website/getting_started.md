## Using CDB IDs

How would you like to use the CDB Database?
* I want to use the data to [secure my systems]({% link consume/end-user.md %}).
* I want to use the data and [publish it]({% link consume/publisher.md %}).

Currently, all the data is provided via Git. In the future, we plan to provide an API. [If you want to contribute to the API work, click here.](https://github.com/cvedb/cdb-tools/labels/api)
